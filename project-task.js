üè® JSON Syntax Debugging: Hotel Booking Data
===========================================

üéØ Objective:
Students will analyze a JSON file containing multiple syntax errors,
identify the issues, and correct them.

This activity helps practice spotting and fixing common JSON mistakes such as:
- Missing commas
- Incorrect use of quotation marks
- Unmatched brackets/braces
- Trailing commas
- Invalid data types

// üß≠ Instructions:
// ============================================

/*
üìò Scenario:
You‚Äôre a developer on a team building a travel booking API.

A teammate submitted a JSON file to represent a hotel booking, 
but it contains multiple syntax errors that prevent it from being parsed.

üîß Your Task:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Review the provided JSON file
2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify all syntax errors
3Ô∏è‚É£ Write down what each error is and why it causes a problem
4Ô∏è‚É£ Correct the JSON structure so that it is valid
5Ô∏è‚É£ Validate your corrected version using a JSON linter or validator

üß™ Deliverables:
- A corrected version of the JSON
- A list of the corrections made and why each was necessary

/*
 - missing comma at the end of line 50; must have commas separating key/value pairs in objects
 - name key missing quotations on line 54; key are all viewed as strings and must be in quotation marks
 - use null instead of undefined on line 60; null goes in place of a number when the number is unknown
 - email is wrong format on line 61; email format must end with a .com in order for it to be read as an email
 - remove last comma from array on line 67; JSON does not allow commas at the end of an array or object with nothing following
*/

// ============================================
// ‚úÖ Requirements
// ============================================

/*
- Use a JSON validator or linter (e.g., https://jsonlint.com/) to test your final version
- Keep track of each fix:
  ‚Ä¢ What was wrong?
  ‚Ä¢ Why is it a problem in JSON?
  ‚Ä¢ What did you change to fix it?
*/


// ============================================
// ü§î Follow-Up Questions
// ============================================

/*
üí¨ Reflect and answer the following:

1Ô∏è‚É£ What tools or techniques did you use to identify the errors?
    I used the common errors in the lesson to find the errors in this program.

2Ô∏è‚É£ How did you confirm that your corrected JSON file was valid?
    I used jsonlint.com to validate the JSON code.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Which errors were the most difficult to spot? Why?
    I missed the missing comma at the beginning. I think my eyes just jumped right over it.

4Ô∏è‚É£ What strategies can help you avoid these kinds of errors in the future?
   (e.g., syntax highlighting, linters, writing JSON by example)
    I think the use of linters will be helpful in the future. They are a quick check to make sure things are correct.
